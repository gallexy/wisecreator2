## How to use

You can create wordwise enabled books for Amazon Kindle by using
- either [standalone executables](#standalone) or
- [pure python script](#script) (runs faster)

To enable wordwise, the lang meta data of your .mobi files should be set to `eng`. You can use `ebook-meta example.mobi -l eng` to change the meta data.
